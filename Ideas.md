# Potential Ideas for the Course

- Getting Inside the Mind of a FRC Robot Programmer
  - How do I start a task?
  - How do I approach a problem that arised and fix it?
- Helpful Intermediate Java Syntax
  - Review of OOP principles
    - Objects
    - Abstraction (concept)
  - `class` vs `interface` vs `enum`
  - Functional Interfaces
    - brief introduction to "passing functions" instead of normal object with functional interfaces
    - probably only use WPILib functional interfaces (`DoubleSupplier`, etc.)
- Creating Clean, Modular, Maintainable 
    - Writing Multiple Subsystems and Multiple Commands
    - Switching between different Auto routines cleanly
    - Good Codebase conventions
      - Dependency Injection
      - new for 2023 Java: inline `Command`s in `Subsystem` class
- Chaining Commands Together: Advanced Command Usage and Common pitfalls
    - Look out for Command Requirements ~~can be the worst~~
    - Common Command methods to chain other commands
      - Parallel vs Sequential Command groups
      - Parallel Race and Deadline groups
      - Repeat Commands?
      - honestly a lot of [these methods](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj2/command/Command.html) are really really cool
    - Using `Subsystem` methods to make short but elegant commands in the Subsystem portion
- What is PID (feedback) control and why/when should I use it?
  - PID control is just math
  - The Porportional gain: A closer look
  - The Integral gain: A closer look
  - The Derivative gain: A closer look
  - PID Tuning Guidelines
- What is Feedforward control and why/when should I use it? 
  - Basics of Feedforward control
  - does ReCalc work? almost I think
  - FF Tuning a Flywheel
  - FF tuning for an Arm
- Odometry for dummies
  - What is Odometry?
  - Why isn't my odometry exact?
- Swerve drive for dummies
  - What is Swerve?
  - Breaking out the Swerve Module as a class (why?)
    - Can reference things from the "Getting Inside the Mind" section with topics such as reducing boilerplate code, making code easier to maintain and debug, etc.
  - Programming the drive motors
    - make motors go spinny
  - Programming the turn motors (oh boy so2 angles here we go)
    - make more motors go spinny
  - Using WPILib to tell the swerve modules what to
  - Swerve Pains to look out for
    - Help! Teleop drive works but my robot is going in "random" directions when I try to run auto!
    - Help! I'm browning out!
- FSMs (Finite State Machines) in FRC
